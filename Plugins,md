## [Obsidian Plugins](https://help.obsidian.md/Extending+Obsidian/Community+plugins)

You can extend Obsidian with plugins built by the community. As Community Plugins run third-party code that could potentially do harm, it is always recommended to test plugins separately before you install it to your main vault and also to use plugins that have enough users and maintenance.

Here, I will share some community plugins which I use in my Vault.

Plugin Name | Purpose
--|--
[Obsidian Dataview](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/) | Live Index and Query Engine for Obsidian
[Obsidian Excalidraw](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin?tab=readme-ov-file) | Open Source Virtual Hand Drawn Style Whiteboard
