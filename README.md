# Guide to Obsidian & My Obsidian Vault

[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) is a great software for note-taking and knowledge management but it might be not that easy to set it up in a way that it works for you. I had to spend a lot of time in learning and applying different things in my obsidian vault finally I got a better way for me to manage notes in it. I hope this might be helpful for ones who prefer the obsidian setup similar to of mine. This will be a guide on how to use Obsidian and my Vault.
