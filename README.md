# Guide to Obsidian & My Obsidian Vault

[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) is a great software for note-taking and knowledge management but it might not be that easy to set it up in a way that it works for you. I had to spend a lot of time in learning and applying different things in my obsidian vault finally I got a better way for me to manage notes in it. I hope this might be helpful for ones who prefer the obsidian setup similar to of mine. This will be a guide on how to use Obsidian and my Vault.

## Why your Setup?

This is a good question. You might wonder why you should use my setup. Fair enough. The best thing is I have found a way to organize my notes and also a way to **navigate back and forth**. This took me a lot of time to build. I hope this will be a huge time saver for you in setting up your Obsidian Vault. You can alter it.

## Backup and Sync

As this is saved locally unless if you are using premium cloud storage, you will be responsible for to manage the backups of your Obsidian Vault. You can use [syncthing](https://syncthing.net/) for that purpose. I use between my PC and Android Phone. If you don't know how to use it. You can check on YouTube for tutorials. And also you can take **manual backups** when ever you want as snapshots in case if you want to go back at any instance.
